# Information Retrieval (IR)
"Information Retrieval is a field concerned with the structure, analysis, organization, storage, searching, and retrieval of information."
Gerard Salton, 1968

## IR core issues

  * Relevance
  * Evaluation
  * Information needs

## Main topics of the course:
  * Retrieval Models (VSM, VSM with TF.IDF, BM25, LM, BM25F, MLM)
  * Implementation: Inverted Files (an efficient & flexible data structure to make search faster)
  * Evaluation: Cranfield Paradigm
  * Entity Retrieval and Linking (Learning to Rank (LTR))
  * Machine Learning for Search
  * Federated Search 
  * Spoken Content Retrieval (SCR) (For certain queries, google.com provides jump-in points to YouTube videos)
  * Link Analysis (Page Rank)
  * Knowledge Graphs and Semantic Search  
  * Neural IR and Conversational Search (BERT models)
  * Conversational Search & Information Seeking
  * Online Learning to Rank (Optimizing a Ranking System with User Interaction Logs)

## Final Project
  * Title: Graph Representations of News Articles for Background Linking
